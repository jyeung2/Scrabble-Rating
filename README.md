# Scrabble-Rating

You are using metadata about the games as well as turns in each game (i.e., players' racks and where and what they played, AKA gameplay) to predict the rating of the human opponents in the test set (test.csv). You will train your model on gameplay data from one set of human opponents to make predictions about a different set of human opponents in the test set.
